# Dotfiles

My OSX dotfiles.

## About this project

This was initially forked from [cowboy/dotfiles](https://github.com/cowboy/dotfiles), I then realized that I need this once every couple of years, and every time I need it I have to face many software release and related problems.

So I am trying to make it as simple as possible, with a couple of manual steps that I'm forced to learn and understand.

## How does this works

I have to write some docs.

## License
Still a to do.
